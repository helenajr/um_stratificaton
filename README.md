# Risk stratification in uveal melanoma
Code required for the paper 'Sensitivity and specificity of different prognostic systems when used to stratify for surveillance in a population of uveal melanoma patients'

To understand this project:
1) Read the paper/ dissertation (not published yet)
2) Read '1_assemble.md', '2_clean.md' and 'Analysis.md' which walk through different elements of the code
3) Scripts contain the full code as R scripts which are described by the .md files. They should be run in order.

I'm still adding code to cover all the steps between assembly and analysis.

The data is not publicly available because it is sensitive and there is a risk of re-identification. Contact the Ocular Oncology Biobank at the University of Liverpool with any queries regarding access.
