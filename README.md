# Risk stratification in uveal melanoma
Code required for the paper 'Sensitivity and specificity of different prognostic systems when used to stratify for surveillance in a population of uveal melanoma patients'

To understand this project:
1) Read the paper/ dissertation (not published yet)
2) Read 'Analysis.md' which walks through different elements of the code
3) 'Analysis.R' and 'Functions.R' in scripts contain the full code for the analysis part.

I have not yet included the code / explainer for the data wrangling part - work in progress
