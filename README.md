# Risk stratification in uveal melanoma
Code required for the paper 'Sensitivity and specificity of different prognostic systems in metastatic uveal melanoma surveillance'.

You might be interested in this repo if:
1) You want to review or repeat the analysis in the paper
2) You are working with the same, or similar dataset
3) You want to do similar analysis on a different datatset

To understand this project:
1) Read the paper/ dissertation (not published yet, but ask me for a draft).
2) All the code files live in the 'scripts' folder. Run these in order to repeat the analysis in the paper.
3) If you want any commentary on the scripts read '1_assemble.md', '2_clean.md' and 'Analysis.md' which walk through different elements of the code.
4) If you can't find the information you need please message me.

I'm still adding code to cover all the steps between assembly and analysis.

The data is not publicly available because it is sensitive and there is a risk of re-identification. Contact the Ocular Oncology Biobank at the University of Liverpool with any queries regarding access. You will need to have some understanding of R to understand this code. If you want to learn / improve your R; https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ or https://nhsrcommunity.com/ are good resources to draw on.
